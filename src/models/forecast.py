# TODO: Implement ingredient demand forecasting model.
#  - Load cleaned sales and usage datasets from data/staged/
#  - Aggregate ingredient usage by month or week
#  - Apply time series forecasting (e.g., Prophet, ARIMA, or sklearn regression)
#  - Predict next N periods of demand for each ingredient
#  - Save forecast results to data/processed/forecast_ingredients.csv
#  - Include evaluation metrics (MAE, RMSE) for model validation
